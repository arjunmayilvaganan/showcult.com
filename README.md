A Platform for the Movie Maniacs
## Background
In 2016, this project was coded an experimental initiative by [Arjun](https://github.com/arjunmayilvaganan), [Raakesh](https://github.com/raakeshmadana) and [Thangaram](https://github.com/thangaram611). Idea contributions from [Ajay Gautam](https://github.com/ajaygtm). As undergrad students, we were trying to learn the MERN stack and develop a movie database, given our craze for movies back in the days.

## Instructions
1. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
2. Set Some mongo DBUrl as `env` variable `MONGODB_URI` (Although the seed data would be pretty useless at this point)
3. Perform seeding and webpack build: `npm run build`
4. Start the server `npm start`

The index will be served at http://localhost:3001/
